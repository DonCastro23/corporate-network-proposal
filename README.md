<h1>Corporate Network Infrastructure Proposal for Namaste Taste</h1>

Project Description:
This project involved designing a comprehensive IT infrastructure for a fictional restaurant enterprise, Namaste Taste, with a focus on secure, scalable, and efficient network operations. I developed a detailed implementation plan centered on Windows Server and Active Directory, integrating user and group management, Group Policy configurations, access control measures, file and print sharing, and audit policy enforcement.

The project included:

Virtualization setup using VMware for server deployment.
Active Directory configuration with defined organizational units (OUs) and role-based access controls.
Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to enforce security restrictions (e.g., disabling control panel access, autolocking sessions, password policies).
File and folder permission structures tailored to departments, using best practices for least privilege.
Audit and security guidelines for threat detection and compliance.
Windows and Linux system integration for hybrid infrastructure support.
A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and appendices with step-by-step technical procedures.
The deliverable was a fully documented proposal with technical implementation guides and system configuration strategies, simulating a real-world enterprise IT rollout.

Key Highlights:
Access Control: Demonstrated implementation of user/group management and role-based access using Active Directory and GPOs.
Security Policy Enforcement: Applied system hardening measures (e.g., disabling cmd/run/search, enforcing password complexity, restricting user access).
Audit and Monitoring: Introduced audit policies to log and detect suspicious activity, aligning with incident response best practices.
System Integration & Network Security: Set up secure Windowsâ€“Linux integration with clear firewall and sharing rules.
Defense in Depth: Layered multiple security mechanisms including permissions, GPOs, and encryption suggestions.
